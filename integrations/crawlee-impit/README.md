# crawlee-impit

An HTTP transport for crawlee-rs backed by [impit](https://github.com/apify/impit). It sends
requests with the TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprints of real browsers (Chrome, Firefox or Safari), which
many anti-bot systems check. impit is also the default HTTP client of Crawlee for JS.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use crawlee::http_client::{HttpClient, RedirectingClient};
use crawlee::{HtmlContext, HtmlCrawler};
use crawlee_impit::{Browser, ImpitTransport};

let client: Arc<dyn HttpClient> = Arc::new(RedirectingClient::new(ImpitTransport::new(Browser::Chrome)));
let crawler = HtmlCrawler::builder()
    .http_client(client)
    .request_handler(|ctx: HtmlContext| async move { Ok(()) })
    .build()?;
```

`ImpitTransport` only does single request/response exchanges. `RedirectingClient` handles
redirects, cookies, sessions and timeouts, as it does for the default reqwest transport. One impit
client is kept per proxy URL, so connections are reused.

## Why it is not part of the main workspace

impit only builds with patched `rustls`, `h2`, `tower-http` and `hyper-util` (Apify forks), and
with `--cfg reqwest_unstable`. Cargo applies `[patch]` sections only in the workspace that
declares them. Adding the patches to the main workspace would force every crawlee-rs user onto
the forks, so this crate is its own workspace, and so is every project that uses it.

## Using it in your project

The crate is not published yet, so depend on it by git. Your project needs four things.

1. The dependency, in `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   crawlee = { git = "https://github.com/apify-projects/crawlee-rs" }
   crawlee-impit = { git = "https://github.com/apify-projects/crawlee-rs" }
   ```

2. The patches, also in `Cargo.toml`, at the same revisions as in this crate's
   [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml):

   ```toml
   [patch.crates-io]
   h2 = { git = "https://github.com/apify/h2", rev = "7f393a728a8db07cabb1b78d2094772b33943b9a" }
   rustls = { git = "https://github.com/apify/rustls", rev = "23b2c17427c095b768e22ccf0dadb97266860cf1" }
   tower-http = { git = "https://github.com/apify/tower-http", rev = "f9efc0d9193e774d33aedc1022b922efefc22052" }
   hyper-util = { git = "https://github.com/apify/hyper-util", rev = "9b7795dfd7158fc55e7c84b65bf1dae1d2dea67d" }
   ```

3. The cfg flag, in `.cargo/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [build]
   rustflags = ["--cfg", "reqwest_unstable"]
   ```

4. Versions that match the forks. The `h2` fork is version 0.4.7, and newer `hyper` releases
   require a newer `h2`. Cargo then resolves `h2` from crates.io and warns that the patch is
   unused. Pin the versions this crate is tested with (see [`Cargo.lock`](Cargo.lock)):

   ```sh
   cargo update -p hyper --precise 1.8.1
   cargo update -p reqwest@0.13 --precise 0.13.2
   cargo update -p h2 --precise 0.4.7
   ```

   Then check that `cargo tree -i h2` shows `h2 v0.4.7 (https://github.com/apify/h2...)`.

## Tests

```sh
cd integrations/crawlee-impit
cargo test
```

`tests/client_hello.rs` checks the impersonation on the wire. It captures the TLS ClientHello each
transport sends to a local listener, then checks for the browser markers:
- Chrome: a GREASE cipher suite, ALPS and ECH.
- Firefox: delegated credentials and a record size limit, without GREASE.
- Plain reqwest: none of these markers.

The test runs locally because a remote fingerprint echo service only sees whatever proxy sits in
between.

`cargo run --example fingerprint` prints the JA4 and HTTP/2 fingerprints reported by
https://tls.peet.ws, for a check against the real thing.
